# CassandraDB object mapper scope

# object-y things...more important

* relationship queries (against supercolumn indexes)
* triggers (primarily for updating relationships)
* domain validations
* read-repair migrations (e.g. define update rules for when you read 
  an unmigrated record and have to convert it...might require a schema version column)

# storage-y things...less important

* type casting (esp. dates)
* optional strict or relaxed field lists
* serialization (should probably steal or mask the serialization in the current client)
* some kind of crap to let you do column_family compound key indexes (cluster-wide) 
  the same way as supercolumn indexes

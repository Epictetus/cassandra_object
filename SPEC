# CassandraDB object mapper scope

# object-y things...more important

* relationship queries (against supercolumn indexes) #DONE
* triggers (primarily for updating relationships) #DONE
* domain validations #DONE (needs more in AMo)
* read-repair migrations (e.g. define update rules for when you read 
  an unmigrated record and have to convert it...might require a schema version column) #DONE by not associations yet.

# storage-y things...less important

* type casting (esp. dates) # DONE but Needs to build on something in AMo
* optional strict or relaxed field lists # DONE (.attributes returns other attributes ditto read_attributes)
* serialization (should probably steal or mask the serialization in the current client)
* some kind of crap to let you do column_family compound key indexes (cluster-wide) 
  the same way as supercolumn indexes
